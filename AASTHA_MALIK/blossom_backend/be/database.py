#Basically, first you will write it on your draft, then you will copy it in your notebook, those notes, with your pencil. And auto-flush stays till the pencil, so if you want to make the changes, you can erase it and use it again, this, that, blah blah. And for auto-commit, when you say commit, only then that, those notes are written on pen, which means permanently.
